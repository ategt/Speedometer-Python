Four days into a five day fast.  The wires came loose and made havoc.
Heard a crack again, not sure what it was.  This round felt easy and recover happened quickly.
First time six! Felt like I left some in the tank, so I could make it.
Tried to push harder this time. Still missed a que in the middle. Heard crack again.
Fasted and dehydrated.  Been two weeks since one of these.  Raining/cold out or I would have run.
